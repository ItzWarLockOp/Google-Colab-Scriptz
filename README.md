# Google-Colab-Scriptz

I don't know coding so i used ChatGPT to create these notebooks. 

#1- Torrent to Gdrive

#2- I Created 3 Scripts to download m3u8 and if i want to select one i will recommend (stream downloader) it supports most of the m3u8 and hls.

#3- Link to Gdrive

#4- Mega Folder to Gdrive

#5- Zip/Unzip

#6- Youtube Video Downloader



 
#7- Copy Shared Gdrive Folder to My Drive



Hope you like these notebooks and i'm going to add more notebooks in future. üéà
